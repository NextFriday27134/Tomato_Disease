# Tomato Leaf Classification

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying different types of tomato leaves. The model is trained using leaf images and can be used to detect possible plant diseases.

## Notebook Structure

1. **Importing Libraries** – Required libraries for data processing and model building are imported.
2. **Loading Data** – Leaf images are loaded for training, testing, and validation.
3. **Data Preprocessing and Augmentation** – Transformations are applied to enhance model performance.
4. **Creating the Model** – The CNN architecture is defined.
5. **Compiling and Training the Model** – Hyperparameters are tuned, and the model is trained.
6. **Evaluating the Model** – Performance is tested on new data.
7. **Saving the Model** – The trained model is saved for future use.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
